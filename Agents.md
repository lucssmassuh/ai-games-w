## Orcs Hunter
in the /orcs-hunter folder there are files with javascript code that implement the objects used in the game.
/orcs-hunter/Hero.js contains the code for the main character, who's an elf depcited by the /orcs-hunter/assets/hero.png file. The hero throws arrows at the orcs and dragons. It moves left and right and fires with spacebar.
/orcs-hunter/Dragon.js contains the code for the dragons, who are depicted by the /orcs-hunter/assets/dragon-red.png file.
/orcs-hunter/Orc.js contains the code for the orcs, who are depicted by the /orcs-hunter/assets/orc.png file.
/orcs-hunter/Arrow.js contains the code for the arrows, which are depicted by the /orcs-hunter/assets/arrow.png file. They fly from the hero's arch to the orcs and dragons. The angle of the arrows is calculated to match the arrow trajectory which is given by the strenght of the shoot (how long is the spacebar key hold) and the position of the mouse.
/orcs-hunter/game.js contains the code for the game, which is a tower defense game where the player controls the elf to defend the castle from waves of orcs and dragons. The game uses Cocos 2D V3.13 sdk which is available at /orcs-hunter/cocos2d/cocos2d-js-v3.13.js.
/orcs-hunter/project.json contains the project configuration.
/orcs-hunter/waves.json contains the waves of enemies to be spawned.
/orcs-hunter/Wizzard.js contains the code for the wizard enemy, which is a stronger variant based on BigOrc logic and is depicted by the /orcs-hunter/assets/wizzard.png file.
